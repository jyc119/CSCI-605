Problem 1: Public class was mislabelled as Problem when the file name is Problem1. Error type is compile time.
Problem 2: i cannot be an integer, needs to be string because string class was used. Error type is compile time.
Problem 3: Integers cannot divide by 0 because INFINITY is not available for integers. Error type is run time.
Problem 4: y has no type. Needs to be int type. Error type is compile time.
Problem 5: There is no return statement for if x is not less than y. Error type is compile time.
Problem 6: The array "list" is empty so trying to get the value at index 0 results in an error since it does not exist. Error type is run time.
Problem 7: The variable 'ch' of type Char is initialized with a String type so the types do not match. Error type is compile time.
Problem 8: The variable j was not initialized before being used in the method. Error type is compile time.
Problem 9: 0.0 if not specified with an f or d is a double by default so float cannot be utilized there. Either change
float to double or specify 0.0 as a float. Error type is compile time.
Problem 10: Indexing starts at 0 so the last character in the string is at index 10 and the index value of 12 is exclusive when using substring().
The 12 needs to be 11 because 12 is accessing a character outside the string. Error type is run time error.
