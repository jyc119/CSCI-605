Problem 1: Public class was mislabelled as Problem when the file name is Problem1. Error type is compile time.
Problem 2: i cannot be an integer, needs to be string because string class was used. Error type is compile time.
Problem 3: Cannot divide by 0. Error type is run time.
Problem 4: y has no type. Needs to be int type. Error type is compile time.
Problem 5: There is no return statement for if x is not less than y. Error type is compile time.
Problem 6: The array "list" is empty so trying to get the value at index 0 results in an error since it does not exist. Error type is run time.
Problem 7: A string was created so there is no Char class. Error type is compile time.
Problem 8: The variable j was not initialized before being used in the method. Error type is compile time.
Problem 9: 0.0 if not specified with an f or d is a double by default so float cannot be utilized there. Either change
float to double or specify 0.0 as a float. Error type is compile time.
Problem 10: Indexing starts at 0 so the d in the string is at index 10 and the index value of 12 is exclusive.
The 12 needs to be maximum 11. Error type is run time error.
